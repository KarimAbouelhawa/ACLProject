# Project Title
The theme of the project is to create a complete Online Learning System. It is a web application through which individuals can signup as trainees or instructors and buy courses or upload them to the website.

## Motivation
We are doing this project as it is assigned as a part of the Advanced Computer Lab course to us GUC 7th semester students.

## Build Status
Due to circumstances and conflicts in the team, the work on the project was delayed and many requirements were stashed. After the scrum master abandoned the team the project was in chaos for a couple of days, but after a bit things got back on track and the remaining members worked together as a team to overcome this hurdle. Unfortunatly, too much damage was already done and we were in a time crunch so around 80% of the requirements were completed.

Coroporate trainees requirements were abandoned as well as some of the admin requirements. Forget password part in the login page does not work.

## Code Style
ES6 code standard was attempted to be used ,but due to the abandonment of the scrum master every member had to resort to his own coding style.

## Tech/Framework used
The project is done using MERN stack and github as the tech to connect the our branches. MongoDB worked greatly as a database due to its simplicity and that saved us a lot of time. The database includes 8 tables but mainly 4 are used in the project. NodeJS was used in the backend to set up the server and create the data models as well as setup the model controllers and APIs. React was utilized with html and css to design the frontend. Due to its vast libraries, it helped in making the development process smoother with libraries like "react-cookie" to transfer data between pages and "react-router-dom" to make the routing between the web pages easier. Express helped to build pages on top of the NodeJS and was great in managing the server and connecting the routes.

## How to use
You start at the login page. You can start by signing up by clicking the signup button. After entering your credentials and agreeing on the policies your data will be added to the database and now you can login normally using the login page. After logging in you will be redirected to the home page where you will see all the courses and the most popular ones. On the left side you can search and filter the courses. If you click on the profile picture at the top right you will be redirected to your profile page. In your profile page you can sign out, change your password, see how much you have in your wallet if you have previously refunded any courses and see all the courses that you bought if you bought any.
